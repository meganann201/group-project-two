        "steps": ["Preheat oven to 400 degrees.", "In a small baking dish combine tomatoes, garlic, oregano, and olive oil along with a pinch of salt. Toss to coat the tomatoes evenly.", "Roast for 30 minutes.", "While the tomatoes are roasting, add balsamic vinegar to a small saucepan over medium-high heat.", "Bring to a simmer, reduce heat and gently simmer for 12-15 minutes, or until it reduces by about half and it easily coats the back of a spoon.

        "recipe_name": "Pasta With Lemon-Parmigiano Sauce",
        "description": "This creamy, dreamy lemon-Parmigiano pasta is the ultimate last-minute meal. The sauce is quickly assembled as the pasta boils away and is made up entirely of items you should always have in your pantry: dry pasta, lemon, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and olive oil. The magic ingredient here is the pasta cooking water, which takes the starch from the cooking pasta and uses it to bind the lemon juice, grated cheese, and olive oil to make a perfect pasta sauce.",
        "user_id": 2,
        "steps": ["In a medium bowl, vigorously mix the lemon zest and juice, cheese, oil, ½ teaspoon salt, and a few generous grindings of black pepper so the cheese “melts” into the oil and lemon juice. Taste, adding more salt and pepper to your liking; set aside.", "Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil (1 tablespoon of salt for every 6 cups of water). Cook the pasta, stirring occasionally, according to the package directions. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the pasta cooking water.", "Return the drained pasta to the hot, empty pot. Pour the lemon-Parmigiano sauce over, tossing with ½ cup of the reserving cooking water to make a creamy sauce that clings to the strands, adding more cooking water as necessary. Add the basil and toss once or twice just to incorporate.", "Divide the pasta among bowls. Garnish with more Parmigiano-Reggiano."],
        "ingredients": ["2 organic lemons, zested and juiced", "3/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for serving", "1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil", "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 pound spaghetti or angel hair pasta", "20 large fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced"],

        "recipe_name": "Penne With Roasted Cherry Tomatoes",
        "description": "This exquisitely simple recipe came to The Times in a 2001 article about Paola di Mauro, an Italian winemaker in Marina, a small town southeast of Rome. She was one of a band of cooks who helped distinguish cucina casalinga, roughly translated as housewives' cooking. From her humble kitchen, Ms. di Mauro mentored some of the best Italian chefs and restaurateurs in the United States, including Mario Batali, Lidia Bastianich, Piero Selvaggio and Tony May. Her recipe is easy and calls for just five ingredients – cherry tomatoes, olive oil, pecorino romano and penne pasta – but get your hands on the best ingredients you can afford. Ms. di Mauro intended this to serve four as a first course, but if you're making this for dinner, double the recipe.",

        "steps": ["Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line bottom of casserole dish with cherry tomatoes in a single layer, halved side up. Pour oil on top, season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle cheese and bread crumbs on top. Bake until tomatoes have wilted, about 20 minutes.", "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with enough sea salt so that water tastes mildly of salt. When tomatoes are just about done, add penne to water and cook until al dente (it should be pliable, but still firm in center). Scoop out about a cup of pasta water and reserve. Drain pasta and add to casserole. Fold tomatoes and pasta together, adding another 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil, to coat. Taste and adjust seasoning. If it is dry, add a little reserved pasta water. Serve, passing more grated cheese at the table."],

        "description": "These chocolate peanut butter cups are dangerously simple to make, with just a few ingredients that you probably have in the pantry right now. They come together faster than a trip to the convenience store. And they are completely customizable. Once you’ve gotten your fill of the standard peanut butter cup, try honey-sweetened cashew butter cups. Or cinnamon-spiked almond butter cups. Drizzle the finished cups with a bit of white or milk chocolate, some flaky sea salt or a sprinkle of finely chopped nuts for an upgraded presentation. Or sneak a tiny dollop of raspberry jam underneath the peanut butter layer for another delightfully classic pairing. The possibilities are endless.",

Let cool at room temperature for about 15 to 20 minutes until mostly solid.", "Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, stir together peanut butter, confectioners’ sugar, vanilla extract and salt. (Make sure the peanut butter is well-combined in the jar before you measure it.) Transfer the peanut butter mixture to a resealable plastic bag and seal it tightly.", "Cut one corner of the plastic bag and pipe 2 to 3 teaspoons of peanut butter mixture into the center of each cup. With a very lightly moistened finger, tamp down the peanut butter and make it flat and even, but leave a bit of space between the peanut butter and the edge of the paper cup (you should be able to see a ring of chocolate peeking from below the peanut butter).", "Melt the remaining 5 ounces of chocolate. Spoon 1 teaspoon of chocolate onto the top of each cup. Use an offset spatula or a small spoon to spread the chocolate evenly over the top and down the sides of the cup. Refrigerate until solid, about 30 minutes."],

        "description": "This banana bread from Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything is really something special. One-fourth of the flour is whole wheat, which contributes a kind of depth you’d miss if it weren’t there. There are walnuts — not unusual, but again, you’d miss them if they weren’t there, And the key, secret ingredient, is coconut. Which really puts the thing over the top.",

Gently stir in the vanilla, nuts, and coconut.", "Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, until nicely browned. A toothpick inserted into the center of the bread will come out fairly clean when it is done, but because of the bananas this bread will remain moister than most. Do not overcook. Cool on a rack for 15 minutes before removing from the pan."],

Enter these delectable pancakes, in which a bit of coconut flour is swapped for the usual all-purpose flour. A generous helping of banana lends a rich creaminess to the cakes.
